---
## üöÄ Overview
*Secure Co-pilot* is a context-aware AI assistant integrated directly into Chrome.
It helps users rewrite, refine, and enhance text inside any webpage's text fields ‚Äî securely and privately.
Unlike cloud-based tools, this extension leverages *on-device AI APIs* (chrome.ai) to ensure zero data leakage.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Proactive Suggestions:** A subtle üõ°Ô∏è icon appears next to your text field, offering rewrites or grammar corrections as you type.
-   **Three Powerful Modes:**
    -   **Auto Mode:** Intelligently detects tone (casual, unprofessional) and suggests improvements.
    -   **Professional Mode:** Actively rewrites text to be more formal, constructive, and suitable for a business context.
    -   **Grammar Mode:** Focuses solely on correcting grammar and spelling mistakes.
-   **Complete User Control:** Easily switch modes, disable the extension on specific websites, or turn it off entirely from the popup menu.
    -   Enable / Disable globally or per-site
    -   Block or unblock specific sites
    -   "Clear Data" option removes all stored preferences
    -   Clean, Minimal UI ‚Äî Suggestion bubble appears neatly above text fields without disturbing the page layout.
    -   Offline-Ready ‚Äî runs fully offline once installed

-   **Works Everywhere:** Enhances your writing in `textarea` elements and `contenteditable` divs across the web.
-   **100% On-Device Processing:** All AI analysis happens locally on your machine, even when you're offline.
-   **Fallback Support:** If Chrome's AI APIs are unavailable, the extension uses built-in local logic for basic suggestions.

## üîí Privacy is Paramount

This extension was built for professionals who handle sensitive information. For the Google Chrome review team and our users, we want to be crystal clear:

**No user data is ever sent to an external server. All processing is done on your local device.**

How is this possible?
-   **`chrome.ai` API:** We use Chrome's built-in, on-device AI models (part of Project Gemini Nano) for all suggestions. This allows for powerful AI assistance without a connection to the cloud.
-   **`chrome.storage.local`:** All settings, including your list of disabled websites, are stored securely on your machine, not synced to the cloud.
-   **No Network Requests:** The extension's core functionality makes no network requests with your text.
-   **Fallback Logic:** When AI APIs are unavailable, local JavaScript functions handle classification and suggestions without external calls.

## üöÄ How to Use

1.  **Start Typing:** Begin writing in any supported text field on any website.
2.  **See the Icon:** The üõ°Ô∏è icon will appear in the top-right of the text field once you've written enough text (minimum 10 characters).
3.  **Hover to View:** Hover over the icon to see the AI-powered suggestion in a tooltip.
4.  **Accept or Dismiss:** Click "Accept" to replace your text with the suggestion, or "Dismiss" to keep your original text.
5.  **Customize:** Click the extension icon in your Chrome toolbar to open the popup and change modes or disable the extension for the current site.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology and Permissions

This extension is built with Manifest V3, ensuring it meets modern standards for security and performance.

-   **`storage`:** Used to save your personal settings (mode, disabled sites) locally on your machine.
