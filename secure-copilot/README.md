# Secure Co-pilot ðŸ›¡

*Proactive, Privacy-First AI Assistant for Sensitive Text Fields*

---

## Overview

Cloud-based AI tools like ChatGPT are amazing, but they canâ€™t safely touch sensitive professional data (performance reviews, contracts, patient notes, etc.). Secure Co-pilot solves this problem by providing *real-time, client-side AI suggestions* *without ever sending data to the cloud*.

This is a *Chrome extension* that acts as a "data-blind" AI co-pilot. It:

- Monitors text inputs and contenteditable fields.
- Detects unprofessional or casual writing.
- Suggests professional rewrites or grammar fixes *proactively*.
- Runs entirely on-device (client-side) for *maximum privacy*.
